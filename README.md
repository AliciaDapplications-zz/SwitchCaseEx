# Switch Case Example
This program calculates average for 5 test scores. The 5 test scores are entered by the users, then the average is calculated by a function. Then an if else statement converts the number average to a letter, (A, B, C, D, F). The letter is then passed through a switch case that displays a message directed to each letter grade.
